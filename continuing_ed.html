        <h1>Continuing Education Integration with 3rd Party</h1>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Built a system to house continuing education (CE) courses that operate very differently than our health and safety training courses.</li>
          <li>Created a categorization system for CE courses that allows filtering by multiple dimensions.</li>
          <li>Built a tiered CE credit pricing system that allows customers to purchase individual courses directly or else purchase credit that can be redeemed later (or a combination).</li>
          <li>Built a dynamic evaluation system that allows each course to have a unique evaluation at the end of it with different types of questions (likert, radio, checkbox, free form, etc.) in which some questions were optional and some were required.</li>
          <li>Built certificate bundles that are made up of multiple stand-alone CE courses. When a certificate bundle is purchased, a final certificate is only presented once all CE courses are passed.</li>
          <li>Worked with another CE content provider through API endpoints to import new courses or modify their existing courses.</li>
          <li>The 2nd provider's courses were categorized differently and values needed to be cleaned up upon arrival (interspersed, broken HTML along with plain text; inconsistent labeling; missing fields).</li>
          <li>Many of the courses had errors or misspellings throughout, so I created a <a href="proofreading.html">proofreading system</a> that notified a proofreader to go through any new courses or changes in current courses.</li>
          <li>Adapted the current functionality to allow for both CE providers' courses to live harmoniously within 1 system.</li>
        </ul>

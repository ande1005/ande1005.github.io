        <h1>Work Experience</h1>
        <h2 class="qualification_title">Design Pickle, LLC (Scottsdale, AZ -- remote)</h2>
        <h3>Senior Ruby on Rails Engineer (July 2018 - Present)</h3>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Led the Product Team as the most senior (and sometimes only) technical employee at the company</li>
          <li>Product managed the creation of the Fresh Stock library within the Design Pickle app</li>
          <li>Created and documented an API for making requests</li>
          <li>Built a Zapier app, moved it to production, and created Zapier templates for the app</li>
          <li>Built request templates that pre-fill saved values for a request based on URL parameters</li>
          <li>Opened up the request platform to users who are not logged in so they can submit 1 request</li>
          <li>Restructured database tables to save all request information coming in (previously, it was just passed through to a 3rd-party application) to allow editing of submitted requests and auto-saving draft copies of requests</li>
          <li>Full database restructure to support companies with multiple users (previous structure was individual user accounts with multiple associated email addresses for submitting requests via email)</li>
          <li>Built a custom design management platform to move off of Freshdesk, saving $80,000+/year and allowing for custom functionality that fit our operating processes much better</li>
          <li>Changed the request form to be a step-by-step process with a beautiful UI/UX redesign to replace the old 1-page form, added new fields, removed old fields (while preserving backwards compatibility), and added Asana-like detail tasks that you can add to your request and the designer can check off to make sure they took care of all parts of the request</li>
          <li>Restructured database tables and almost every file in the code base a second time to allow for multiple plan types and multiple subscriptions per customer. This opened up the ability to expand into subscription-based services in other creative areas; improved the look and feel of modifying a customer's subscription types, billing period, and quantity; made coupon options much more flexible and full-featured; and allowed for multiple currencies and easy switching of default pricing plans. I also saved as much information as possible in our database, so API calls to Stripe only happen when necessary.</li>
          <li>Hired, mentored, and managed 2 other developers, overseeing multiple projects including moving all delivered assets from Box to Filestack and the building of a stock asset library</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>UI/UX Refresh</h1>
        
        <p>In the Fall of 2020, after being in business for nearly 6 years (which was mostly filled with growing, building new features, and running as quickly as possible), Design Pickle decided to undergo its first site-wide redesign. Up until this point, the site could best be described as functional. It was not ugly, but it was not pretty.</p>
        
        <p>With a growing Product Team (it had recently grown from 3 to 7 engineers, from 1 to 3 UI/UX designers, and from 1 to 3 product managers), we decided that it was finally time to upgrade the UI/UX of the site. This included an upgrade from Bootstrap 3 to Bootstrap 4, incorporating the Hyper Bootstrap theme, adding a new dashboard page upon login (instead of taking you right into the request form), and updating the request form again.</p>
        
        <p>As the team grew, this was the first project that I had very little direct involvement in. I checked in weekly to ensure progress and to guide decisions, but the team ran largely independently. The engineers and designers collaborated to make small decisions, and I ensured everyone on the team was up to speed and able to contribute.</p>
        
        <p>In the final two weeks before launch, I helped organize and prioritize a backlog of required tasks and push the project across the finish line, cleaning up any broken pages and ensuring that all pages had been considered in the rewrite.</p>
        
        <p>Although we did not run A/B tests or do a slow rollout to gauge customer reaction, I believe this was a huge improvement across the board for the site. The navigation is much clearer, there is a much more obvious call to action on each page, and it gives the site a solid foundation that was built out purposefully.</p>
        
        <p>This was also a big movement forward in my ability to delegate and trust that work would be completed without my direct involvement. By managing from a higher level and ensuring everyone on the team was moving in the right direction, I was able to direct multiple projects simultaneously and help the company move at a faster pace.</p>
